                <p className="justify-center p-3"> Aizen's Zanpakuto: Kyoka Suigetsu (Japanese for "Mirror Flower, Water Moon"): In its sealed form, it resembles a normal katana.  The only decoration is the tsuba, which is a hexagon. The two sides parallel to the blade are long, whereas the four sides above and below the blade are shortened, making it into almost a diamond or prism-like shape. It has a green handle.</p>

            <h3 className="text-3xl pt-4"> Shikai: </h3>
            <p className="p-2"> Shikai is the initial release of the Zanpakuto. It's release command is "Shatter", which can be used to activate and deactivate the Shikai. The name Kyoka Suigetsu hints at its illusionary properties; the moon reflected in water and a flower in a mirror are things that can be seen, but not held. It is a Chinese saying for seeing and desiring something that is a dream that cannot be easily grasped in hand, teaching people about temptations. </p>
            <p className="p-2"> Kanzen Saimin (Japanese for "Complete Hypnosis") is Kyoka Suigetsu's Shikai special ability. It controls the five senses to the point that it can make the target misinterpret another person's form, shape, mass, feel, and smell to be that of the enemy. The initiation condition for the hypnosis is to show the enemy the release of Kyoka Suigetsu. After seeing it just once, that person will completely succumb to the hypnosis. After that, every time it is released, that person will fall under the thrall of the hypnosis. The hypnosis is long-lasting, maybe permanent. When he turns off the hypnosis by force of will, the image shown melts away or shatters. Kyoka Suigetsu's Complete Hypnosis is absolutely flawless; even if the target is aware that they are under the hypnosis, they cannot resist its influence. Kyoka Suigetsu's hypnotic abilities make it a highly useful tool in combat, as Aizen can quickly create simple or complex illusions to deceive his opponents. For example, by creating a decoy of himself, or other illusions to distract his opponents, Aizen can hide his own movements and attack with impunity. His opponent will remain focused on the illusion until it's too late to react.</p>
